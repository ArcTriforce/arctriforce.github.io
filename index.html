                <hr>
            <p>
                Kinda just an update post on life lol 🐦 (-Robyn)
            </p>
            <p>
                We have started going to a Psychologist *every week*!! This is SO EXCITING. Nick waited YEARS for this (and he never got to experience it himself. L tbh /j)
            </p>
            <p>
                This psychologist is really nice, and her name is Amalie. She even let me speak, and didn't keep rambling on about a really small topic  I don't really care that much for :3
            </p>
                <hr>
                <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p>
                on the other hand, loads of new system members! Me, Nadia and Leyley for ex. Idk if anyone else. but yeah! :3
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also frontstuck and in an episode of some kind, don't exactly know what's happening but. :shrug:
                <br>I'm the Exorelatian (the headmate that takes care of external relationships), and also the tea drinker /hj
            </p>
                <hr>
                <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p>
                The Home page got an update, we changed the Diagnoses section a bit, and generally just fixed a few minor mistakes.
                <br>Also changed the Peoples section a very tiny bit (Changed Copypasta's name to Soup and added "protector" to Kaden)
            </p>
            <p>
                The Era 2 members have been learning how to do HTML properly lol- we have the basis, but details have been iffy-
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                Off-topic but Soup (Previously known as Copypasta) got locked out of front by Kaden (Our protector & Archivist) for wishing rather bad things upon us (not cool girlypop!)

            <h1>I'm so sorry #8 - 12/10-2023</h1>
                <hr>
            <p>
                I don't know how to start this, uhm.
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all, sorry we haven't been keeping this place updated. We have a Twitter (X) Now, <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcTriforce">check it out.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, a huge apocalypse happened within the system. Hello, I'm Copypasta and I am the new host.
                <br>Nicholas is gone, possibly among other previous headmates. We don't know what happened, we don't want to know.
            </p>

                If someone knows what happened, that'd be Kaden, our Archivist. Kaden may or may not come out with more if they would like to, but no pressure will be applied.

                I don't feel comfortable visiting this Website as it is too sad. I might commit a few changes in the future to make it more like home, but please be patient while we collect ourselves, thanks.
                <br>For now, I'll make as many small updates as possible, please let me know if something bugs out or is wrong in some way.

                On the other hand, there's lots of new headmates! So much so our current headspace is way too small to fit everyone. We've discovered another layer as well. It doesn't have a name so far, but it's inhabitants are Kaden and Lucille.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our newest headmates that we are *aware* of- so not those who have formed in headspace and haven't been discovered- Is me first of all, Copypasta/Soup. Then we have Kaden, Peyton/Luz, and Lucille.

            <h1>Day 7 - 26/09-2023</h1>
                <hr>
            <p>
                so some things happened recently. nothing big nothing small lol 🍋
            </p>
            <p>
                Gonna start off with we got a new member! Silly things happened and brain went "no this won't do." and boom!
                <br>He's an introject and I'm personally thinking he might be a symptom holder? Hm, now that I say it aloud, I don't think so.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wouldn't exactly make sense since I'm pretty sure the reason we got him is to embody a bad personality trait. Which means he could possibly be fragmented?
                <br>Or maybe it actually counts more as trauma? So that'd be a trauma holder? I'm not sure.
            </p>
            <p>
                anyways, moving on.
                <br>He's an introject from Heartstopper. And ya'll don't be mad now, but it's Ben Hope ✋
            </p>
            <p>
                He's REALLY talkative. Like, he really wants to front to just chat with people and I think he's mostly being affected by our Autism. I don't think he knows how to manage it yet, either because he doesn't have Autism in source or because he's new. But nobody else has had any issues with managing our Autism after their initial creation? Or maybe they had, but I just didn't notice. Not sure lol /ramble
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways, he wanted to front so bad the other day he gave us a headache from how much he was asking to front. And don't get me wrong, I would definitely let him front but I don't know how to *make* him front, yk?
            </p>
            <p>
                He's also really malicious? I'm not his biggest fan but I can't really blame him for being the same as his source. And when I say malicious, I don't mean like he harasses or yk is aggrevated to people. He's just really malicious to LGBTQ+ people despite being a raging homosexual himself. He just seems to judge everyone and it makes me so. raaahhhh /neg /nm /ramble
            </p>
                <hr>
                <hr style="margin-top: -10px;">
            <p>
                ANYWAYS, changing topics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our ADHD has gotten so bad we basically just cannot function in school, therefore we're gonna start going half-days. At least until we get our medication in minimum 3 months from now :p
            </p>
            <p>
                That'll be nice!
            </p>
            <p>
                oh yeah, CRK (Cookie Run: Kingdom) had an update and FINALLY introduced another ancient cookie! Golden Cheese Cookie :3, AND SHE'S OP ASF, at least in PVE. She's probably going to be in the PVP meta as well :p so that'll be fun!! :DDD I can't wait to do everything available this season, and see all the new cookies that are to be released soon ^w^ 
            </p>
            <p>
                not sure what else to say. sorry for the Ben ramble lmao
            </p>

            <p>
                This was really interesting. 🍋
            </p>
            <p>
                I had always known we were related to the monarchy of Russia before it's abolishment, but today I got more information!
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only are we related, but we have DIRECT heritage to the Tsar and saint himself, Nicholas II of Russia 😭 WHICH IS REALLY IRONIC CAUSE MY NAME IS NICHOLAS. (I guess I'm Nicholas the III now /j)
            </p>
            <p>
                He and his direct family were deemed saints of Passion Bearers after their death :p
            </p>
            <p>
                And unless you hadn't already picked up on it, Nicholas II was the emporer of Russia, and the the father of the infamous Princess Anastasia of Russia. yk, the girl from the Disney movie SJDHFS
            </p>
            <p>
                We would've inhereted land due to the heritage, but the land was handed down to our Grandad's, Sister's daughter instead due to our dad not being in contact with our grandad anymore. So too bad so sad ig 😭
            </p>
            <p>
                But yeah! that's pretty cool!! :D
            </p>
            <p>
                Other than that our day wass fine :p, went to the grocery store! super cool! Hope ya'll had a good day :DD

                🧦 Hello! Harvey here, I took over front not too long ago and immediately decided to do blog because I really like doing the blog.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, my day has been fine haha. Watched a 37 minute long reaction video with 2 other people, Jade and Seraphim.
            </p>
            <p>
                We did an unofficial (self-administered) assesment in Dissociative Disorders and PTSD and scored enough to indicate the presence of a dissociative disorder at 73% likelihood.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have an accent. I didn't know that. 😅
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm going to be working a bit on my Spotify playlist! You can listen <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7mCFtZQUDOfp7NTVPi8W3j?si=30369bd2a9b94e04" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <hr>
            <p>
                Nick and Seraphim stayed up late last night jokingly diagnosing their friend with Tulpamancy, which turned into more of an assesment on genuine plurality.

            <p>
                Before anything else, I know all kinds of individuals have access to my blog, and therefore I want to take a moment to say my heart goes out to those who lost their families and close ones on this very day, 22 years ago.
                <br>You have my eternal prayers. May god guide your loved ones, and be with you 🙏

                on with the blog!
            </p>
            <p>
                Among the chaos being our childhood, I stressed to research everyday, every month and every year to find what was wrong with us.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent so many nights literally dreaming of getting a diagnosis or generally having a professional by our side.
            </p>
            <p>
                WELL, BOYS AND GIRLS. AND QUEERIOS.
                <br>TODAY WAS THE DAY.
            </p>
            <p>
                my stupid ahh didn't even know it was our diagnosis appointment 😭 I came there dressed in pink sweatpants bro LMFAO
            </p>
            <p>
                I am soso happy to liberate that burden off of our inner child's shoulders, she deserved the world and more
            </p>
            <p>
                and bro 😭😭 what an UNFORTUNATE day to be diagnosed on. I am actually so shook LMAO
                <br>looks like all that waiting paid off 💀
            </p>
            <p>
                I know people are assholes so I have a screenshot of our diagnosis paper, just in case. Won't share it unless needed though, obv
            </p>

                <hr style="border-style: solid;">

            <p>
                other than that, I don't really have much to talk about. I guess today was very exhausting so I took a damn long nap, but that's about it 🤷‍♂️
            </p>
            <p>
                off-topic- but me and Harvey really like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgSTS3sPc28" target="_blank">Jellyfish playlist</a>, so go check that out if you want lmao

                <hr>
            <p>
                Was told to update our blog more often so here goes :p 🍋
            </p>
            <p>
                This is Day 2 of Harvey fronting ;w;. 
                According to our Simplyplural, it has been a total of 1D 22h since he was added to front in our Simplyplural.
                <br>And that's just when we added him to our Simplyplural, so it's probably been just about 1D 24h now :p (which is just 2D in total)
            </p>
            <p>
                Then again, we- as in everyone collectively- have not had good inner-communication skills at alllll, and everything everyone says has always been really fuzzy, unless they're in front.
                <br>Harvey was never like that though. He's been really easy to communicate with, and therefore I don't know if it's because he's in front or if he just generally has good communication skills.
                <br>I think it's because he's co-conscious though, so I'll keep saying he's in front until something says otherwise lol
            </p>
            <p>
                On another note, I heard of something called EMDR therapy, which sounds really interesting. Some say it could end up really badly, which is fair.
                <br>I'm probably not going to perform anything like it. I don't want to accidently erase any symptoms right before our diagnoses lmao. It'd just further complicate the process.
            </p>

                <hr style="border-style: dashed; margin-top: -10px;">
            <p>
                I feel like I'm getting more connected with our system, which is super yippeh! :autism:
                <br>I always felt extremely disconnected and like an outlier before this. I couldn't really interact with anyone intentionally, I just kind of had to let everything happen naturally.
                <br>But Harvey has helped me get more connected with our plurality, and he is very happy to help!! :3, and I'm very thankful! I wonder if that was his creation purpose? eh, labels are too complicated tbh
            </p>
            <p>
                I also seem to be giving our brain ideas sbdjhfjh, I keep thinking "Imagine if this was a headmate?", AND THEN WE IMMEDIATELY DISSOCIATE
                <br>I get so scared everytime like "NO PLEASE NO HEADMATE" DBJHFGJHDF /lh /npa /hsilly
                <br>Not that it's bad to have headmates, but I don't want us to start randomly growing out of nowhere, yk? Try to avoid it as much as possible, basically
            </p>

                <div id="custom-hr1" style="padding-bottom: 27px;"></div>  

            <p>
                We've also updated the website a bit :p, like a very small bit.
                <br>We've added a fourth resource link on the Home page, and I removed the clickable link on blog post #2 cause it's bugged. 
                Not entirely sure how to fix that lol
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also working on 2 other websites for the fun of it, so that's awesome :D
                <br>They're meant to be template websites for others to make completely custom websites like us :p, one is simplistic & dark, and the other is Cookie Run themed xD

            <p>
                Anyways, I am going to take a wild guess and say that we're gonna get a factive soon. Or maybe he already exists, there's a very strong presence-
                <br>We'll see next time ya'll here from us >:3, bye bye for now !!

                    <br>Nicholas has just asked if I wanted to get on the website, which I happily agreed to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Harvey, and despite what it looks like, I am not an introject.
                    <br>I just happen to look a lot like Harvey in Stardew Valley, and the name indifference doesn't make that any better 😅
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any case, I believe I am the second male headmate (excluding Nicholas) in the main system, the other one being dormant.

                    <br>You may find a lot of information is missing, that is because I have not been here long yet. Therefore I don't know a lot about myself yet 😅
